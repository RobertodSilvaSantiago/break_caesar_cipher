# break_caesar_cipher

The given code is a Python script that performs Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. It involves the following components:

It imports the string module from the Python standard library, which provides various string constants and helper functions.

It defines a multi-line string variable named MESSAGE, which represents the ciphertext of a Caesar cipher-encrypted message. The key used for encryption is unknown.

It defines a function encrypt_char that takes a character and a shift value (key) as input and encrypts the character using a Caesar cipher. The function performs the following steps:

The shift value (key) is adjusted to ensure it falls within the range of 0 to 25 (inclusive), representing the 26 letters of the alphabet.
Decimal values are assigned to a, y, A, and Y, corresponding to the ASCII values of lowercase and uppercase letters.
If the input character is not a letter, it is returned unchanged.
The decimal value of the character is incremented by the shift value (key).
If the character is uppercase and the resulting decimal value is greater than Y, the value is brought back into the uppercase letter range using the modulo operation.
If the character is lowercase and the resulting decimal value is greater than y, the value is brought back into the lowercase letter range using the modulo operation.
The encrypted character is converted back to a character using the chr() function and returned.
It defines a function encrypt_caesar that takes a plaintext string (text) and a shift value (key) as input and encrypts the text using a Caesar cipher. The function iterates over each character in the input string and calls the encrypt_char function to encrypt each character individually. The encrypted characters are concatenated to form the encrypted text, which is returned.

It defines a function main that serves as the entry point of the program. It uses a loop to iterate over 25 possible shift values (1 to 25) and prints the decrypted versions of the MESSAGE variable using different shift values. It calls the encrypt_caesar function with the MESSAGE and the current shift value, and formats the output as "Version x: decrypted_message", where x represents the shift value.

The main function is executed only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module) by checking the __name__ variable. This allows the main function to be executed when the script is run as the main program.

In summary, the code takes a Caesar cipher-encrypted message stored in the MESSAGE variable and attempts to decrypt it by trying all possible shift values. It prints the 25 decrypted versions of the message to the console.
